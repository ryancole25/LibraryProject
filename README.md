# LibraryProject

Library Project for The Odin Project

I made this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project allows you to add a book (title, author, number of pages, and whether you have read it) through an input form onto the on-page library. The library can then be sorted using the sort controls that I added to the page. You can also continously add more books, or delete specific books using the "X" button on each website.

This project taught me a little more about the power of using Objects to organize data in JavaScript as well as different ways that you can manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.
